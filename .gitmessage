# CVEWatch Commit Message Template
#
# Use conventional commit format for better changelog generation:
#
# <type>(<scope>): <description>
#
# [optional body]
#
# [optional footer(s)]
#
# Types:
#   feat     - A new feature
#   fix      - A bug fix
#   docs     - Documentation only changes
#   style    - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
#   refactor - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#   perf     - A code change that improves performance
#   test     - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#   chore    - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
#   breaking - A breaking change (use with caution)
#
# Examples:
#   feat(cli): add new search command with advanced filtering
#   fix(nvd): resolve API rate limiting issue
#   docs(readme): update installation instructions for Apple Silicon
#   refactor(config): simplify configuration loading logic
#   test(nvd): add integration tests for API client
#   chore(deps): update Go dependencies to latest versions
#   breaking(api): change default output format from simple to table
#
# Scope is optional but recommended for clarity
# Description should be in present tense and concise
# Body can provide additional details if needed
# Footer can reference issues: Closes #123, Fixes #456
